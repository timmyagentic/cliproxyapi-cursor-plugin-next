# CLIProxyAPI Cursor Plugin

Connect Cursor to CLIProxyAPI with streaming, images, tool calls and quota reporting.
Uses CPA's global proxy and request logging. Native Go plugin; no Node.js runtime required.

[中文说明](README_CN.md)

## Store installation

After a Release is published, add this third-party source:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: /opt/cpa/plugins
  store-sources:
    - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spancerxing/cliproxyapi-cursor-plugin/main/registry.json"
```

Install **Cursor** in CPA's store. Release builds target Linux AMD64/ARM64,
macOS AMD64/ARM64 and Windows AMD64; CPA selects its runtime platform, including the Linux container architecture
for Docker. No build tools are needed at runtime. Mount a writable plugin directory for Docker.
Once listed in the official registry, the third-party source is optional.

## Build from source

Requires Go 1.23+, a C compiler and Make. Build on the same OS and CPU architecture as CPA:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/spancerxing/cliproxyapi-cursor-plugin.git
cd cliproxyapi-cursor-plugin
make build
```

Output in `dist/`: `spx-cursor.so` on Linux, `spx-cursor.dll` on Windows, or `spx-cursor.dylib` on macOS.
Windows builds require a matching MinGW toolchain.

## Install in CPA

CPA must support C ABI v1 plugins. Copy the library into the plugin directory and enable it in CPA's configuration:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: /opt/cpa/plugins
  configs:
    spx-cursor:
      enabled: true
      priority: 1
```

Set `dir` to the actual path, restart CPA and check its loading logs.
For Docker, mount the plugin directory and use its container path.
Manual installation requires the compiled library; CPA cannot load a source directory or a GitHub repository URL directly.

## Sign in

Choose Cursor login in CPA. If the UI has no entry, use CPA's v8 management API:

```sh
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8317/v8/management/oauth/auth-url?provider=cursor' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY"
```

Open the returned `url` to authorize, then poll with the returned `state` until `status` is `ok`:

```sh
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8317/v8/management/oauth/status?state=$STATE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY"
```

### API key login

After installing the plugin, open **Cursor** in CPA's plugin resources menu.
Enter the CPA management key, a Cursor API key and an optional account label,
then choose **验证并保存** (validate and save). The plugin validates the key with
Cursor before asking CPA to persist the account. Refresh the account and model
lists afterward. The page does not store keys in browser storage. Browser login
remains available through CPA's Cursor login entry.

The default resource URL is `/v0/resource/plugins/spx-cursor/login`.
Use the resource link in your management panel if CPA uses a different prefix.

Alternatively, import a Cursor API key credential into CPA:

```json
{
  "type": "cursor",
  "cursor_auth": {"type": "api", "key": "YOUR_CURSOR_API_KEY"}
}
```

## Use

Get model IDs from CPA's `/v1/models` and select a `cursor/…` model in your client.
Browser tokens require signing in again after expiry. Per-account proxy overrides are currently unsupported.

## Development

```sh
make test
```
